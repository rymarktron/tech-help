## Project for Hack for the Future
A website that breaks down complex tech concepts into manageable and easily digestible pieces with images. 

## Inspiration
When I was on the bus ride to McGill hacks in Montreal, Canada last weekend, a lady asked me for some help with technology. She asked me to disable photo sync on WhatsApp, as well as changing her Facebook from public to private. The whole idea with technology is to sort of help with different types of users, and give good explanations on how the technology works, and what to do about their problems.

## What it does
The more one knows how to approach these problems, the stronger they will be in technology and using it in the future. Technology is constantly evolving, making it crucial to have access to resources where questions can be asked and answered through clear, visual instructions. Add learn from step-by-step instructions with analogies and pictures to represent ideas. This is empowering to all people.

## How I built it
- Built on react (front end) with node to connect it the back end

## Challenges we ran into
- Getting a domain. Took time to figure it out purchasing it, and name server linking (new jargon)
- Figuring out .env files to protect the API Keys from the public to work
- Connecting the API to the website

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Domain works! First time using a domain
- Mobile friendly (adjusted to different windows - 600px)
- CSS and formatting of the page

## What we learned
- Using the .env file (Did not know how to use it) for local and public (vercel needed API keys)

## What's next for Techknowledgy
- Add the images tool (did not work)
